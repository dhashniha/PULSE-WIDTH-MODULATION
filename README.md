# PULSE-WIDTH-MODULATION
Pulse Width Modulation, or PWM, is a method used to control the amount of power sent to a device by adjusting how long a signal stays on during each cycle. It works by rapidly switching the power on and off, and the length of time the signal stays "on" is called the pulse width.

The ratio of the "on" time to the total cycle time is known as the duty cycle. For example, if the signal is on for half the cycle and off for the other half, the duty cycle is 50%. By changing the duty cycle, we can control how much power a device receives.

PWM is commonly used in various applications like adjusting the speed of motors, dimming LED lights, and in communication systems. Itâ€™s an efficient way to control power because the switching devices, like transistors, use very little energy when they are fully on or off.
